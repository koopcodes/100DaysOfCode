// Tribonacci
// Like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers 
// Create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence
// Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;

function tribonacci(signature,n){
  //your code here
